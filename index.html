    <p>Why do you always keep blocking me? What do you think of yourself? Well, how do you got to know that it was me? You're so smart. Why you behave so rude with me? I know you, you are not that rude. You've got such a beautiful soul, then what's wrong with you, sweetie? Why are you so cold hearted. I know, I was the one who compelled you to do so.<br>
    Why don't you get it that I'm not that bad for you? Why don't you understand that this time I'll never let you down no matter what the situation is. I'll always take care of you. You're so cute, I'll always obey you and I promice that I'll never create troubles for you, never ever. You know what, I'm a real trouble maker and whatever people says to me I always take it 100% literal. Uhh, this is so annoying.<br>
    You know what I like you more than my cat rescue videos, I like you more than my afternoon nap, I like you more than my...um my.. okay, more than anything else. <br>  Scince you've entered in my life, you've made my life miserable. Looks like I'm drownning. Every nonsense started to make sense. I curse that unauspicious day we met.<br>
Hey, do you genuinely want me to get out of your life? Do you really want me to stop chasing you, huh? Tell me? Why don't you speak to me? Why don't you understand that I'm giving up on you? My tears dosen't add any value to your life. You don't care about me at all. Looks like your hatred has reached to an another level.  But you should know that Allah loves me very very very much. And "Dua of tahajjud is like an arrow which never miss its target." - Imam Shafii. So that means, He'll surely bless me with you, wheather you like it or not. You better get it (scremming). I'll be your wife. And of course, I'll always follow the footsteps of Khadijah Bint Khuwaylid (RA.) to serve my husband. Every evening I'll give you a scalp massage to get rid of you stress. I'm immensely good at it. I'll wake you up for tahajjud. I wanna go with you till my last ride. I wanna see your face while taking last a couple of breath. When my time comes, I won't you to be there for me. Even if you don't want to. <br>
<br> Do you know how much cute you are? Let me tell you, without beard you look like a 13 year old kid and with beard 17 year old boy, haha ha hha hahahaðŸ¤£. Tell me somthing, 15 december, BGIFT's so called function was held. Why did you were mask there? If I'm not wrong, you usally don't right? Did you expected me there?  and you were ashamed to show your face to me after blocking me? or you had pimples on your face? Whatever, you were looking like the head of the robbers(dakat sorder) but as always your were like cuteness overload.  Uff, I can't take this anymore.<br> <br><br> Your know what, my younger brother teases me because of you. He keeps pulling my leg by asking  "How is your computer sir doing?  Does he talk to you now?" and so on. When the third time you blocked me, he sent me this<a href="c5cf40cd-c855-47cd-a667-559da1fc5b48.png">(Click Here) </a>I hate both of you from the bottom of my heart. You get it? </p>
